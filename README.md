# bonsai-data
This is an open-source project being developed to visualize ontologies using immersive environments. This is primarily 
achieved through force-directed graphing, but the technique is modified in order to make the vidualization bi-directional in nature, 
as opposed to an omnidirectional spread of nodes and edges.

# Tasks to be completed
Create .txt or .csv reading functionality in Unity so we don't have to manually enter data
Determine standard data format to use between directory scanner and Unity
Creat directory scanner that has .txt or .csv output
Create procedural modified force-directed visualization code in Unity.

# Initial Goal
Initially we want to be able to drop the compiled project into a directory, and when that program is run a tree-like 3D structure is generated based on the structure of the directory.

# Long-term Goal
Once this works for the initial use-case, we want to use this to visualize larger shared directory systems, budgets, associates, assets, and other organizational structures.

# Background on Project
The Bonsai Data project that originally started at the 2016 MIT Reality Virtually hackathon. See the original repo 
[here](https://github.com/OhioAdam/Data-Tree-Modeler), and the DevPost [here](https://devpost.com/software/data-tree-modeler).
An initial [medium post](https://medium.com/@UpAndAdam/planting-a-seed-e7461f1abd58) was written to give a summary of the ideas initially
discussed for this project, and a [follow-up post](https://medium.com/@UpAndAdam/bonsai-data-cultivating-the-numbers-54a92968af82) was
made once it was developed further at the Smart City Hackathon in Columbus, OH. Further posts will be made as this is developed out into a 
functional program.
