# bonsai-data
This is an open-source project being developed to visualize ontologies using immersive environments. This is primarily 
achieved through force-directed graphing, but the technique is modified in order to make the vidualization bi-directional in nature, 
as opposed to an omnidirectional spread of nodes and edges.

The Bonsai Data project that originally started at the 2016 MIT Reality Virtually hackathon. See the original repo 
[here](https://github.com/OhioAdam/Data-Tree-Modeler), and the DevPost [here](https://devpost.com/software/data-tree-modeler).
An initial [medium post](https://medium.com/@UpAndAdam/planting-a-seed-e7461f1abd58) was written to give a summary of the ideas initially
discussed for this project, and a [follow-up post](https://medium.com/@UpAndAdam/bonsai-data-cultivating-the-numbers-54a92968af82) was
made once it was developed further at the Smart City Hackathon in Columbus, OH. Further posts will be made as this is developed out into a 
functional program.
