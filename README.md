# What is the Bonsai Data modeler?
This is an open-source project being developed to visualize ontologies using immersive environments. This is primarily 
achieved through force-directed graphing, but the technique is modified in order to make the vidualization bi-directional in nature, 
as opposed to an omnidirectional spread of nodes and edges.
