# What is the Bonsai Data modeler?

This is an open-source project being developed to visualize ontologies using immersive environments. This is primarily achieved through force-directed graphing, but the technique is modified in order to make the vidualization bi-directional in nature, as opposed to an omnidirectional spread of nodes and edges.

\# Background on Project

The Bonsai Data project that originally started at the 2016 MIT Reality Virtually hackathon. See the original repo [here](https://github.com/OhioAdam/Data-Tree-Modeler\), and the DevPost [here](https://devpost.com/software/data-tree-modeler\). An initial [medium post](https://medium.com/@UpAndAdam/planting-a-seed-e7461f1abd58\) was written to give a summary of the ideas initially discussed for this project, and a [follow-up post](https://medium.com/@UpAndAdam/bonsai-data-cultivating-the-numbers-54a92968af82\) was made once it was developed further at the Smart City Hackathon in Columbus, OH. Further posts will be made as this is developed out into a functional program.

# Tutorial

Clone this repo and run this using Unity 2017.1 or newer. Press the "Play" button, and use your mouse to navigate the camera around the tree.



# Force Directed Graphing

> **Force-directed graph drawing **algorithms are a class of [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) for [drawing graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing) in an aesthetically-pleasing way. Their purpose is to position the nodes of a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28discrete_mathematics%29) in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space so that all the edges are of more or less equal length and there are as few crossing edges as possible, by assigning forces among the set of edges and the set of nodes, based on their relative positions, and then using these forces either to simulate the motion of the edges and nodes or to minimize their energy.
