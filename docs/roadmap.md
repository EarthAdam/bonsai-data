# Roadmap

## Short-Term Goal

Initially we want to be able to visualize the layout of a file directory by loading a log of its layout into Unity. From there, a 3D tree will be built with each branch reflecting each nested folder. The trunk being the root folder for the directory.

## Mid-Term Goal

Be able to drop a compiled .exe file into any directory, and upon opening it scans the directory from that location, and creates a 3D tree

## Long-Term Goal

Make this a time-based tree. For Git directories this is possible because every change is recorded with a timestamp. Other file systems may be more difficult unless they have some way of keeping track of changes over time.

## Eventually

Once this works for the initial file directory use-case, we want to use this to visualize larger shared directory systems, budgets, associates, assets, and other organizational structures.
